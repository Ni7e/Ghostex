/*
 * CDXC:Release 2026-09-15 DECISION:
 * User: every platform goes live the moment its own build finishes, without
 * waiting for any other platform. The publish order is whatever the build
 * order happens to be; nothing waits for macOS and macOS waits for nothing.
 * So one release run publishes in five independent stages (macos, android,
 * linux, windows-x64, windows-arm64). The first stage to finish creates the tag
 * and the release with its own products; every later stage amends that release
 * with its own products. A stage that loses the creation race simply amends.
 * Supersedes the 2026-09-10 design where the macOS stage always created the
 * release and the others waited for it.
 *
 * WHY: the stages share only three things: the tag, the provenance asset, and
 * the release notes. Tag creation is atomic on GitHub's side (the second push
 * of the same tag is rejected), which is the whole race arbiter. Provenance and
 * notes are merged with a read-merge-verify loop rather than a lock, because a
 * GitHub concurrency group keeps one pending run and cancels the others, which
 * would silently drop a product's publication.
 *
 * A stage's product set is its own products plus the gxserver runtimes those
 * products embed, because a shipped app of this version resolves the runtime
 * from `v<version>` and must never find it missing. The runtimes therefore
 * belong to several stages; whichever publishes first uploads them, and later
 * stages verify the live digest instead of uploading again.
 * SEE-ALSO: .github/workflows/release-gpui.yml (the stage jobs),
 * .github/workflows/release-gpui-publish.yml (one call per stage),
 * publish-staged.mjs (create-or-amend), assemble.mjs, amend-existing.mjs.
