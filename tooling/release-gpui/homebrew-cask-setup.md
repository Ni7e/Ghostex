# Homebrew cask publishing: one-time setup

Every stable release updates two casks from the macOS publish stage of
`.github/workflows/release-gpui-publish.yml`, through
`tooling/release-gpui/publish-homebrew-cask.mjs`:

- the official `ghostex` cask, `Casks/g/ghostex.rb` in
  [Homebrew/homebrew-cask](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask), by opening a
  version-bump pull request from the `maddada/homebrew-cask` fork on a
  `ghostex-<version>` branch, titled `ghostex <version>`;
- the legacy personal tap, `Casks/ghostex.rb` in
  [maddada/homebrew-tap](https://github.com/maddada/homebrew-tap), by committing
  straight to `main` so `maddada/tap/ghostex` installs keep updating.

Both edits change `version` and `sha256` only. The sha256 is the digest GitHub
records for `ghostex-<version>-arm64.dmg`, cross-checked against
`release-provenance-<version>.json` when the release carries one.

## Secret: `HOMEBREW_GITHUB_API_TOKEN`

One GitHub token for the `maddada` account, stored as a repository secret on
`maddada/Ghostex`. The workflow step is skipped with a message when the secret is
missing, so nothing breaks before it is added.

Fine-grained personal access token (preferred):

- Resource owner: `maddada`.
- Repository access: **Only select repositories**, pick `maddada/homebrew-cask`
  and `maddada/homebrew-tap`.
- Repository permissions: **Contents: Read and write**, **Pull requests: Read and
  write**, **Metadata: Read** (added automatically).
- No account permissions, and no **Workflows** permission (the `workflow` scope
  of a classic token). The script never copies upstream commits into the fork,
  so it never has to write under `.github/workflows`; see the fork section.

A fine-grained token opens the pull request against `Homebrew/homebrew-cask`
even though that repository is not in its list: creating a PR only needs write
access to the fork branch and read access to the public upstream.

Classic token alternative: scope `public_repo` only. It grants push and PR rights
on every public repository the account can write to, so prefer the fine-grained
token.

The token must belong to the account that owns the fork: the script derives the
fork owner from `GET /user` with this token and pushes the bump branch there.

```sh
gh secret set HOMEBREW_GITHUB_API_TOKEN --repo maddada/Ghostex
```

Paste the token when prompted, or pipe it in: `gh secret set
HOMEBREW_GITHUB_API_TOKEN --repo maddada/Ghostex < token.txt`.

`HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN` is optional. When set, the tap push uses it instead of
`HOMEBREW_GITHUB_API_TOKEN`; use it only if the tap should be written by a
different account or a token that is not allowed to touch the fork.

## Fork of Homebrew/homebrew-cask

`maddada/homebrew-cask` already exists (it carried the `add-ghostex` submission).
The script forks the repository itself if it is missing. It never syncs the
fork: the `ghostex-<version>` branch is created (or force-reset, on a retry) at
the head commit of upstream's default branch, which the fork can reference
because a fork shares upstream's object network, and the bump is committed on
top of that commit. The fork's own `main` may fall arbitrarily far behind and
nothing reads it. Feature branches such as `add-ghostex` do not interfere.

The fork used to be fast-forwarded with the merge-upstream API before
branching. Release 9.7.0 failed there with HTTP 422, "refusing to allow a
Personal Access Token to create or update workflow
`.github/workflows/check-issues.yml` without `workflow` scope": that sync
copies every upstream commit into the fork, including Homebrew's frequent
workflow edits, which a token limited to contents and pull requests may not
write. Do not bring the sync back or widen the token for it; the pull request
never depends on the fork's `main` being current.

## Autobump

The cask has no `no_autobump!` and its `livecheck` block has no `skip`, so it is
in Homebrew's autobump set: BrewTestBot checks `appcast.xml` on `main` every
three hours and opens `ghostex <version>` itself when it sees a newer version.

Our PR is still the primary path: it lands minutes after the release, before the
next autobump sweep, with the sha256 verified against the release provenance.
The two never collide: `brew bump` skips a cask that already has an open bump
PR, and the script exits 0 with the existing PR URL when one is open for the
version, whoever opened it. If BrewTestBot beats the workflow (for example after
a publish-only recovery run hours later), the workflow logs that URL and does
nothing else. The script also exits 0 when the live cask already carries the
version.

## Running it by hand

```sh
node tooling/release-gpui/publish-homebrew-cask.mjs --version 9.5.1 --dry-run
HOMEBREW_GITHUB_API_TOKEN=... node tooling/release-gpui/publish-homebrew-cask.mjs --version 9.5.1 --publish
```

`--dry-run` prints the exact diff for both casks and performs no writes.
`--sha256 <hex>` overrides the digest lookup. The local brew-driven tap updater,
`tooling/release-gpui-homebrew.mjs`, still works for the personal tap alone.
