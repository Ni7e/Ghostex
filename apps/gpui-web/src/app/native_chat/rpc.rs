//! The chat view's direct gxserver calls: same signature as the desktop's file, performed with `fetch`.
//!
//! CDXC:WebGpui 2026-09-22 WHY: callers run this inside `background_executor().spawn`, which demands a `Send` future even on the one-threaded web executor, and a JavaScript promise is not `Send`. The fetch therefore runs as a page-local task and only its result, plain JSON, crosses back through a channel. A blocking XMLHttpRequest was tried first and froze the page: the transcript pages older turns in until the viewport is full, and with no repaint between calls it never saw itself fill.
