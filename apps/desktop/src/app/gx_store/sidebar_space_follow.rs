//! The focused row's Space: the per-Space memory a Space switch restores, and the section move
//! `sidebarSpaceFollowActiveSession` asks for.
//!
//! CDXC:Spaces 2026-09-21 WHY:
//! Both halves are `rememberNativeSidebarFocus`, which the deleted sidebar page ran on every focus
//! change. They hang off the end of `gx_store_update_sidebar_list` rather than off a publish
//! (M4d part 2 step 6), so every way focus can move is covered rather than the ones a publish
//! happened to follow, and the list the rule reads is the one this update just built.
