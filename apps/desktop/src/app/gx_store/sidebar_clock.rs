//! The sidebar's own once-a-second tick, and the armed Delayed Send / Close After Done labels the
//! chat's working row draws.
//!
//! CDXC:Sidebar 2026-09-21 WHY:
//! The old projection ran a timer once a second for the life of the app and published a clock row
//! per session (`native-sidebar/clock.ts`). Two things rode that tick and nothing else has their
//! cadence: the armed-timer labels every open chat draws, and the re-read of the two client-storage
//! values the menus need, which a titlebar Keep Awake or an agent launched from another surface
//! moves without the store or a publish ever reporting it. The LIST's own labels do not ride it:
//! the view model says exactly when the next one reads differently and the host books one timer for
//! that moment (`gx_store_book_sidebar_deadline`), so an idle sidebar still wakes once an hour
//! rather than three thousand six hundred times.
