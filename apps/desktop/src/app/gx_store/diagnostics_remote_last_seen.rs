//! The record lines for the last-seen view of an offline remote machine, in a sibling because
//! `diagnostics.rs` is over the size ceiling and waiting for a quiet window.
//!
//! CDXC:RemoteMachines 2026-09-21 WHY:
//! The payload these lines are about holds session TITLES and project PATHS, so none of it reaches
//! a record: a seed line carries the machine count and the byte size and nothing else, and it does
//! not name the machine either, because a machine id is a short fixed string but the size and the
//! count are all a support log needs to say whether the copy was read. A failure carries the error
//! WORD from the door's own closed vocabulary, never a path and never the payload.
//!
//! SEE-ALSO: apps/desktop/src/app/gx_store/remote_last_seen.rs,
//! apps/desktop/src/app/gx_store/remote_clients.rs.
