//! The project the Add Project dialog just added, joining the open Space and going to the top.
//!
//! CDXC:Spaces 2026-09-15 DECISION:
//! User: a project added through the Add Project dialog joins the Space that is open in the sidebar
//! and goes to the top of it. The sidebar page owned both halves (`receiveNativeSidebarEvent`), and
//! it is going away, so the app owns them: the membership is written the moment the dialog reports
//! the project, and the project id is then HELD until the daemon lists it and the sidebar has a
//! group for it, which is when the order can be written at all. A project added to a REMOTE machine
//! takes the same two halves, with the Spaces document sent down that machine's tunnel
//! (`gx_store/remote_project_docs.rs`) and the order posted as the single-machine list
//! `receiveNativeSidebarEvent` posted, which the runtime does write.
//!
//! The held id survives nothing: it is memory only and a launch that never sees the project
//! forgets it, exactly as the page's `pendingAddedProject` did.
//!
//! SEE-ALSO: packages/gx-core/src/sidebar_drag/added_project.rs,
//! apps/desktop/sidebar/native-sidebar/events.ts,
//! apps/desktop/src/app/gx_store/project_docs.rs.
