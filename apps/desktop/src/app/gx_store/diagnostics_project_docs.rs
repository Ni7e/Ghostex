//! The record lines for the Project Group and Space EDITS, in a sibling because `diagnostics.rs`
//! is over the size ceiling and waiting for a quiet window.
//!
//! CDXC:Spaces 2026-09-21 WHY:
//! Nothing a user typed or named may reach these lines. A Project Group carries a title the user
//! wrote and a Space carries a name and an icon, so the lines say which action ran, whether it
//! wrote, and the run's totals, and never an id, a title, a Space name or a path. The counters ride
//! every line because they are the only proof the path fires at all: a run in which the user
//! renamed a Project Group and `renames` is zero means the old runtime is still the only writer.
//!
//! SEE-ALSO: apps/desktop/src/app/gx_store/collection_menu.rs,
//! apps/desktop/src/app/gx_store/diagnostics.rs.
