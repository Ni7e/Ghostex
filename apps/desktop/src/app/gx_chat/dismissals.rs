//! The draft-recovery dismissal compaction: per-revision markers folded into ranges.
//!
//! CDXC:Drafts 2026-09-13 WHY:
//! Over 16,000 per-revision dismissal objects filled the browser's storage quota and made ordinary
//! typing fail to save. A dismissed checkpoint is therefore not left as its own record: the markers
//! of one draft are folded into `[start, end]` revision ranges under a single
//! `ghostex.sessionChat.recoveryDismissed.["<sessionKey>","<draftId>"]` record, gaps preserved, and
//! only then are the markers removed. This is the Rust port of `compactDraftRecoveryDismissals` in
//! `packages/core-ui/chat/session-chat-draft-dismissals.ts`, writing the same bytes: the same key,
//! `JSON.stringify` of an array of two-element arrays, no spaces.
//!
//! Two rules from the TypeScript are load bearing and are kept in its order:
//!
//! 1. **A legacy marker is shrunk in place first**, before anything else is written, so the
//!    migration still fits when the store is already at its bound. A dismissal written before the
//!    marker form existed is the whole checkpoint object with `dismissed: true`; it is rewritten as
//!    the three-element array when that is shorter.
//! 2. **The ranges are committed before their markers are removed.** A crash between the two leaves
//!    a marker that is already covered by a range, which reads as dismissed twice; the other order
//!    would lose the dismissal entirely and offer the user a draft they threw away.
//!
//! What is NOT ported is the page-wide scan and the write lock around it. The lock is IndexedDB's,
//! against another browser page writing the same ranges; here the one writer is the host thread,
//! and it compacts the session it just retired rather than every key in the store.
