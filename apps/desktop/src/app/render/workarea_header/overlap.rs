    The user's approval for the header-over-transcript overlap, and its scope, are recorded on the
    header itself in `shell.rs`; this decides which column may take it. Only GPUI-painted scrolling
    content may pass under the header: a CEF page and a libghostty terminal are AppKit child views
    of the window's content view, so they paint *over* everything GPUI draws, and a view surface or
    a native terminal that reached the top of the column would cover the header
    instead of fading under it. A terminal grid is also sized from its
    body, so two of its rows would sit behind the header where a full-screen TUI needs them. That
    leaves the GPUI chat transcript, which is a scrolling document. Every other column keeps its
    old top edge, one header height below the window.
