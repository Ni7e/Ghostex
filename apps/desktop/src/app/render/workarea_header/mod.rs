//! The workarea header: the row at the top of the workspace column that took over
//! the deleted titlebar's job in the 2026-09-20 titlebarless revamp.
//!
//! Rust allows inherent impl blocks in any module of the crate that owns the type, so each file
//! below is a plain `impl GhostexGpuiApp { .. }` slice and needs no re-export; declaring the module
//! here is enough for its methods to stay callable from every sibling. Phases 3 and 4 of the
//! revamp add to this directory, so keep new header concerns in their own file rather than here.
