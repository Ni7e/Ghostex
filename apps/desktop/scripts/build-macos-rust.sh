# prepare-macos-runtime.sh builds gxserver, then hands the result to

# cargo invocation in one file means both callers compile with identical
# flags and environment, so neither invalidates the other's artifacts.

# The desktop crate is one 170k-line leaf crate, so every local start paid a
# full non-incremental release compile of it (~27s) even for a one-line edit.
# A per-package profile override turns incremental codegen on for that crate
# only: dependencies keep their profile hash and stay served by sccache, and
# release packaging (no GHOSTEX_LOCAL_START) keeps the plain release profile.
# Do not move this into Cargo.toml or the release build inherits it.

	# CDXC:Build 2026-09-23 DECISION:
	# User chose opt-level 0 for the app crate on local starts, with `bun run start --optimized` for performance work.
	# Measured on an M5 Pro: a one-line edit rebuilt in ~5s at opt-level 0, ~17s at 1 and ~20s at 3, and a cold compile used 71 vs 315 CPU-seconds.
	# Only this crate changes: GPUI, CEF, tree-sitter and every other dependency keep release optimization, and debug assertions and overflow checks stay off as in release.
	# SEE-ALSO: prepare-macos-runtime.sh applies the same rule to gxserver.
