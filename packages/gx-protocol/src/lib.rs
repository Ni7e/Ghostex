//! Typed client-side description of the gxserver wire protocol.
//!
//! Rules every type in this crate follows:
//!
//! - Unknown fields never fail a parse (`deny_unknown_fields` is never used), because older and
//!   newer remote daemons are merged into one client.
//! - Every optional wire key is an `Option<T>` (or [`Tri<T>`] where absent and `null` mean
//!   different things) with `#[serde(default)]`.
//! - String enums are open: known variants plus `Other(String)`, so an unknown value round-trips
//!   instead of failing the frame that carries it.
//! - Fields whose shape the protocol survey flagged as loose stay `serde_json::Value`.
//!
//! The crate has no transport code: sockets, HTTP, and reconnect live in the client crate.
