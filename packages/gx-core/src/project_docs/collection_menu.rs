//! A Project Group's own menu items: Rename, the colour swatches, and Ungroup.
//!
//! These are the three `collectionAction` arms that edit the collections DOCUMENT rather than the
//! sidebar's own state. The other four (`toggle`, `select`, `toggleProjects`, `hide`) move what is
//! collapsed, selected and hidden and are sidebar-UI intents, which is why they are not here.
//!
//! Neither edit re-sanitizes, because `updateSidebarProjectCollection` and
//! `removeSidebarProjectCollection` do not: a colour the swatch row sent is stored verbatim and the
//! sanitizer that runs on every READ is what decides whether it is drawable. Sanitizing on the way
//! out would write a document the daemon and the phone would then disagree with about one colour.
//!
//! SEE-ALSO: packages/core-ui/project-collections.ts,
//! the deleted sidebar page's `collections.ts` (`runNativeCollectionAction`),
//! apps/desktop/src/app/gx_store/collection_menu.rs.
