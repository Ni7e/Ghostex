//! The two client-owned documents the project moves write, and the ordering rule they share.
//!
//! `collections` and `spaces` are the documents and their guard policies; `collection_edits` and
//! `space_edits` are the functions the moves apply to them; `collection_menu` is the Project Group
//! menu's own three writes (Rename, a colour, Ungroup) and `space_editor` the New/Edit Space
//! dialog's result, neither of which is a move; `worktree_order` is
//! the nesting rule, which the sidebar list and the project drag must agree on and which therefore
//! has one implementation rather than one each.
