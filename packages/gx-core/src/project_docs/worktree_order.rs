//! Worktrees nest under their parent project, and a project drag carries its family with it.
//!
//! CDXC:Worktrees 2026-09-21 WHY:
//! `packages/shared/project-worktree-order.ts` is generic over an ITEM (`{orderId, projectId,
//! worktree, isChat}`) and the sidebar list only ever needed it over PROJECT IDS, so M4a ported the
//! id-shaped half into `sidebar_view/projects.rs`. The project moves need the item-shaped half,
//! because a drag is keyed by GROUP id and several groups (a project and each of its user-made
//! groups) share one project id. Writing the second half beside the first is how this port's twin
//! bugs start, so the generic lives here and the list's ordering calls it with items built from its
//! own metadata. The user drags worktrees constantly, so a difference between "how the list nests
//! them" and "where a drop puts them" would be visible immediately and attributed to the drag.
//!
//! SEE-ALSO: packages/shared/project-worktree-order.ts,
//! packages/gx-core/src/sidebar_view/projects.rs, packages/gx-core/src/sidebar_drag/project_move.rs.
