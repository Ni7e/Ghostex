//! The project slot hotkeys, cmd+1 to cmd+9: the port of `runNativeProjectSlotHotkey`.
//!
//! CDXC:Sidebar 2026-09-21 WHY:
//! This one is not a sidebar command and never was. It arrives as `gpuiProjectSlotHotkey`, a THIRD
//! route beside the two sidebar-command envelopes, and it reaches into the collapse state and
//! DELETES two keys directly: the project's collapsed flag, and (with
//! `showLessForExpandedProjectJumps` on) its session list's expanded flag. The second one fought the
//! Rust reveal that follows the same jump, because `reveal_plan` may ask for exactly the storage id
//! the hotkey had just removed, so the two wrote opposite values for one key on every jump.
//!
//! The whole jump is planned here: which project the slot names, what it does to that project's
//! collapse state, which row it focuses and whether that row is revealed. The reveal itself is
//! `reveal_plan`, asked by the host AFTER this plan's own intents are applied, which is the order the
//! TypeScript has (the deletions, then the selection, then the reveal at the next build). Supersedes
//! the 2026-09-21 note that the focus and the reveal stayed with the old runtime.
//!
//! **A slot never names a remote project.** The TypeScript indexes `!group.remoteMachineContext`
//! groups of the list it draws, and that list only ever holds the SELECTED machine's groups, so on
//! a remote machine's tab (connected, last-seen or not loaded) the slot finds nothing and the key
//! does nothing at all: no deletion, no selection, no reveal. The remote focus machinery is
//! therefore never reached from here, and nothing here builds a second one.
//!
//! DELETE, not toggle. `runNativeProjectSlotHotkey` removes both keys, so a jump to a project that
//! is already expanded leaves it expanded, where a toggle would collapse it.
//!
//! SEE-ALSO: apps/desktop/sidebar/native-sidebar/hotkeys.ts (`runNativeProjectSlotHotkey`),
//! packages/gx-core/src/sidebar_ui/intents.rs (`ExpandProjectForSlotJump`),
//! apps/desktop/src/app/gx_store/sidebar_slot_jump.rs.
