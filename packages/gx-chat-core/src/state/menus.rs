//! Family e's state: the model picker, the option pills and their menus, accounts, context details
//! and the fork branch picker.
//!
//! **This file belongs to family e (menus, pickers, options, accounts, context).** No other family
//! edits it. Family e1 owns the option, account and settings fields; family e2 owns
//! [`MenusState::picker`] and [`MenusState::context`], the two boxes its subdirectories fill.
//!
//! Read from, never write to: `ChatState::session::selected_options` (family a merges it by
//! evidence priority and `detectedAt`; the document key `selectedOptions` is yours to publish),
//! `ChatState::session::account_switch`, `ChatState::session::pending_model_selection`,
//! `ChatState::session::available_agents`, `ChatState::session::switchable_agents`,
//! `ChatState::session::screen_probed` (latched: it decides between a loading skeleton and a plain
//! unset pill).
