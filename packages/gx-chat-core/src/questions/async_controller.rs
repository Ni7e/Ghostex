//! The async question strip: selection, navigation, explicit submission and retirement.
//!
//! Port of `packages/shared/session-chat-controller/async-questions.ts`. The TypeScript controller
//! is promise based; here the same steps are one state transition plus the effects the host
//! performs, and the answers arrive back as events.
